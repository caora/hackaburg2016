# Hackaburg 2016 - Debattle

***

**Hint:** This project was developed during a hackathon 2016 in Regensburg (Germany). This is just the final state after two days of work, this is not a working product. We were a group of four people and we wanted to release our code in public. This readme should give you an overview over the archtitecture and further it contains links to the running application. So keep this in mind and stay coool :)

## Purpose

The debattle application is actuallay made for revolutionize discussion in the world wide web. Ambitiously - yes maybe! The problem on plattforms as Facebook or Twitter is, that you lose the overview of a discussion. Apart from the fact that a lot of bullshit can be further found in those discussions. So we tried to develope a solution. In debattle you can open discussion on a specific topic and define the pro and the contra position. After that people can comment on this topic. After 24h the round gets closed automatically and the top ten comments pro and contra surrive and after 12h a new round can be opend, if the user votet for a new one. Through this system we try to provide a discussion culture with higher quality.
