# Hackaburg 2016 - Debattle

***

**Hint:** This project was developed during a hackathon 2016 in Regensburg (Germany). This is just the final state after two days of work, this is not a working product. We were a group of four people and we wanted to release our code in public. This readme should give you an overview over the archtitecture and further it contains links to the running application. So keep this in mind and stay coool :)
