<h2>This route is very quick</h2>

<p>
  This route is fast, in fact has no resolve methods or any other heavy load in it, so the loader doesn't appear but you can always
  customize the <b>latency</b> of the module by adding the omonimus attribute to the directive.
  <br>By default the module will wait <b>250ms</b> before show the loader.
  See the official <a href="#">github</a> page to see how it works and how to customize it.

  Thanks to the great power of Angular!
