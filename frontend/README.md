# hackaburg2016
## Debattle

Our idea for this year's Hackaburg is to create a discussion platform.

Each discussion has its own thread and runs for 24 hours, during which users can comment and rate other users' comments. At the end of the 24 hours, a summary is created which lists the 10 comments with the best ratings for each position. (Summary could also contain graphs of participation for each position?) There is then a cool-down period of 12 hours, after which users can vote to have a new discussion cycle opened. If there is enough interest, the discussion will run for another 24 hours.
